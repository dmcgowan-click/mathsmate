A simple app to help you with your maths!

## About Maths Mate

I wanted a simple maths trainer app that would do at minimum the following:

* Give me Times Tables
  * Allow me to set the range anywhere from 2 to 12
  * Allow the questions to be in order or random
* Give me Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division or a mixture of all 4
  * Allow me to set the range from 2 to 20
  * Generate questions randomly based on the provided range
* Use a keypad to enter the answers and be intelligent enough to figure out if the answer is complete or if it still needs input
* On completion, display time taken

## Where I am up to

* Times Tables completed

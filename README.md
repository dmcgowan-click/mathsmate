# Maths Mate

A simple app to help you with your maths!

## About Maths Mate

I wanted a simple maths trainer app that would do at minimum the following:

* Generate timestable equations
  * Allow me to set the range anywhere from 1 to 12
  * Allow the questions to be in order or random
* Generate random equations as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division or a mixture of all 4
  * Allow me to set number of questions from 10 to 100
  * Allow me to set the range from 5 to 20
  * Allow me to set the number of operands from 2 to 3
* Use a keypad to enter the answers and be intelligent enough to figure out if the answer is complete or if it still needs input
* On completion, display time taken

## Where I am up to

* In addition to completing the goals above, I have implemented a tournament mode that starts with easy questions and progressively gets harder

## What still needs to be done

* The descriptive text use throughout the app is terrible. It's not my strong point. This should eventually be fixed by someone who is better with words than I am
* The graphics are very basic and not particularly friendly. Once again, not my strong point. This should eventually be fixed by someone who is better at graphics design than me
* Note happy with the tournament mode. Would like it to be more customizable and expandable, some more design decisions will be needed to decide best approach
* Would eventually like to support things like long addition, division, etc. But would be good to see if any interest here
